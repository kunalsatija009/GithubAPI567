[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/kunalsatija009/GithubAPI567.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/kunalsatija009/GithubAPI567)



When creating the code, I thought about building my function because obtaining the commit history depended on obtaining the repository name. This is because the GET request for the commits needs the name of the repo in the URI.
In order to make it simple to test the program, I had a few example inputs I tested while developing my program to make sure it was working correctly.
The only difficulty I encountered was that it took me a long time for Travis to obtain an accurate result.
GitHub appears to stop me easy when I attempt to test too quickly.
